# Erdos-Data-Viz-2023
This is a repository for my Data Visualization Mini Course Final Project/USTARS network visualization

Every year at the USTARS conference, we draw a network visualization of the connections made at the conference.  In 2023, we decided to create this digitally for the first time.

- `Network 3.ipynb` contains the Python code to create the final interactive network visualization, which is saved as `network3.html`
- `Network 1-Bokeh.ipynb` contains the Python code to create a different version of the interactive network, which is saved as `network_1.html`
- `Old-style Newtork.ipynb` contains the Python code to make a static version of the visualization, which is saved as `oldstyle.png`
- The data cleaning code is in `USTARS-network-data-cleaning.ipynb`

Other files that were used, like the list of registered participants, and the results from the survey we used to collect the data, are redacted from the public Github page.
